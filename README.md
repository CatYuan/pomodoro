## Bugs
This project is simply a means to practice React, as a result the app is not 100% functional or without bugs. Possible fixes to this app include, dealing with unexpected values (ex. putting letters into the timer, not entering a value into the timer, refactoring to reduce repetitive code between TimesUpButton and Timer).
