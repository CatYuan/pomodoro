# Pomodoro
The pomodoro technique is a method that can be used for studying, where one alternates between 25 minute intervals of work and 5 minute intervals of rest. The goal of this app is to help implement this study method.

## Bugs
This project is simply a means to practice React, as a result the app is not 100% functional or without bugs. Possible fixes to this app include, dealing with unexpected values (ex. putting letters into the timer, not entering a value into the timer), refactoring to reduce repetitive code between TimesUpButton and Timer, making the app more responsive to different screen sizes. If there are any major bugs with the app, please leave a comment regarding it, or create a pull request.
